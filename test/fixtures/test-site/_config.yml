  This site is used to assess the 'jekyll-data-revised' plugin.

  Notable change from the default config file generated by 'jekyll new'
  command is the absence of the 'gems:' array. The plugins required by
  this site's theme is handled by the 'config.yml' within the theme-gem.

  Additional plugins that may be required outside the theme's scope is
  added to the ':jekyll_plugins' group in the Gemfile.
